              \begin{itemize}
                  \item {Submitted to \textbf{SIAM Journal on Optimization.}}
                \item Proposed a novel multi-step descent analysis framework and first proved that the \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06653v4}{Push-Pull algorithm} achieves linear speedup over arbitrary strongly connected digraphs. Our multi-step analysis resolved the non-vanishing noise issue inherent in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04928}{traditional single-step approaches}. Also see the \href{https://luoxiaogan.github.io/GanLuo.github.io/PDFs/new_proof.pdf}{[notes]}.

                \item Conducted all numerical experiments to validate the linear speedup property we proved.

                \item {Introduced novel metrics to characterize the influence of row-stochastic mixing matrices and established the first convergence lower bound for decentralized optimization over row-stochastic networks.}
                \item {Developed a new analysis framework proving that \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09169}{PULL-DIAG} achieves linear speedup and proposed a multi-gossip protocol that resolves instability issues and attains the lower bound with near-optimal complexity.}
                \item {Conducted all numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results on convergence lower bound, linear speedup, and near-optimal complexity.}
