GPA(x) = 4-3*(100-x)2/1600

+ Overall GPA: 3.52/4.0 (cohort of 220 students; cohort highest GPA: 3.89/4.0)
  + **Note on GPA**: My GPA was significantly impacted by my first semester (Fall 2022) due to COVID-19 infection during finals. My GPA in subsequent semesters has shown consistent improvement, particularly in advanced mathematics and statistics courses. I believe my research accomplishments better reflect my research capability and potential for doctoral studies.
